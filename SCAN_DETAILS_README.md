# Scan Details Functionality

This update adds the ability to view detailed track information when clicking on recent scans in the scan history section.

## Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema

- **New Table**: `scan_tracks` - Stores detailed track information for each scan
- **Fields**:
  - `scan_id` - References the scan_history table
  - `spotify_track_name`, `spotify_artist_name`, `spotify_album_name` - Spotify track details
  - `serato_track_name`, `serato_artist_name`, `serato_album_name` - Matched Serato track details
  - `similarity_percentage` - Match percentage for found tracks
  - `is_found` - Boolean indicating if track was found in Serato library
  - `variations` - JSON field storing track variations (for found tracks)

### 2. New API Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/scan-history/:scanId` - Retrieves detailed scan results including all tracks
- **Enhanced POST** `/api/scan-history` - Now saves detailed track data along with scan summary

### 3. Frontend Enhancements

- **View Details Button**: Each scan history item now has a "View Details" button
- **Detailed Results Display**: Clicking the button shows the same detailed view as when processing a new playlist
- **Track Modal**: Displays found and missing tracks in both table and list formats
- **Consistent UI**: Uses the same modal and styling as the main results display

## How It Works

### 1. When Processing a Playlist

1. User processes a Spotify playlist
2. System saves scan summary to `scan_history` table
3. System saves detailed track data to `scan_tracks` table
4. Scan appears in recent scans list

### 2. When Viewing Scan Details

1. User clicks "View Details" on any recent scan
2. System fetches detailed track data from `/api/scan-history/:scanId`
3. Results section displays with found/missing track counts
4. User can click "Found" or "Missing" to view detailed track lists
5. Track modal shows complete track information including:
   - Spotify track details
   - Matched Serato track details (for found tracks)
   - Similarity percentages
   - Track variations (for found tracks)

## Database Migration

Run the updated schema to create the new table:

```sql
-- Run the scan_history_schema.sql file
psql -d your_database -f scan_history_schema.sql
```

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify the database setup:

```bash
node test-scan-details.js
```

## User Experience

### Before

- Users could only see scan summaries (counts)
- No way to review specific tracks from previous scans
- Had to re-process playlists to see track details

### After

- Users can click any recent scan to view detailed results
- Full track information is preserved and accessible
- Consistent interface with main results display
- Easy comparison between different scans

## Technical Implementation

### Database Design

- **Relational Structure**: `scan_history` (1) â†’ `scan_tracks` (many)
- **Row Level Security**: Users can only access their own scan data
- **Indexes**: Optimized for fast queries by scan_id and user_id
- **JSON Storage**: Track variations stored as JSONB for flexibility

### API Design

- **RESTful**: Follows existing API patterns
- **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid auth token
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when tables don't exist
- **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing

### Frontend Integration

- **Event Handling**: Click listeners on scan history items
- **Data Management**: Stores scan results in window object for modal display
- **UI Consistency**: Reuses existing modal and table components
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can review past scans without re-processing
2. **Data Preservation**: Detailed track information is saved for future reference
3. **Consistent Interface**: Same UI patterns throughout the application
4. **Scalable Design**: Database schema supports future enhancements
5. **Performance**: Efficient queries and proper indexing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be built on this foundation:

1. **Scan Comparison**: Compare tracks between different scans
2. **Export History**: Export detailed results from past scans
3. **Analytics**: Track matching success rates over time
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple scans for batch operations
5. **Search/Filter**: Search through scan history by playlist name or date
